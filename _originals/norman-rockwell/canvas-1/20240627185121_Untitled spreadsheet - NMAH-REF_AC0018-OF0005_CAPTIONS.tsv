5.06	10.037	[Orchestral violin music plays]
10.426	12.99	[Narrator:] Let's take a moment for a quick trip to Vermont,
12.99	15.652	and visit the home of one of America's most famous artists
15.652	19.046	and beloved illustrators, Norman Rockwell.
21.94	23.79	In back of his house is his studio.
24.072	27.135	So we'll look in at Mr. Rockwell at his easel.
29.214	30.204	[Norman Rockwell:] Hi, there, folks.
30.204	31.66	Come on in. Look around.
31.895	35.205	As you probably know, I like to paint the typical American scene.
35.525	37.429	Take this illustration, for example.
38.29	41.386	It's a view of the gathering of the clan before the television set.
42.178	44.629	And, that's typical most everywhere you go these days.
46.57	47.375	Look over here--
48.616	50.329	The models? Well, they're my neighbors.
50.329	52.329	And that's my DuMont they're watching.
52.329	55.638	I'm painting them from life, just as they come in here almost every evening.
55.638	58	I've painted myself into the picture, too.
58.144	59.939	We really go for television, up here.
60.827	64.21	And to get the most out of television, we do our viewing on a DuMont.
